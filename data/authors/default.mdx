I’m Muyiwa Johnson, a software engineer building full-stack systems that power real-world solutions in education, governance, and digital finance.

At **Valdymas Intelligence** (Texas-based), I’ve led the development of impactful platforms including:

- [**VETLEP**](https://www.vetlep.com): a micro-credit system managing savings, loans, and user transactions.
- [**NYSC Kwara Camp Dashboard**](https://nysckwaraaccount.web.app): a corps member payment and verification platform.
- [**Cooperative Society** — Admin](https://nysckwaractcs.vercel.app/) & [Mobile](https://nysckwaractcs-mobile.vercel.app/): tools for managing contributions and cooperative finances.
- Internal admin systems for educational institutions.

Before that, I led the team at [**Atop Web Technologies**](https://www.atopwebtech.com/) to build **Scorebox**, a dance scoring platform serving thousands in Canada.

I’m also the founder of [**studentFirst**](https://www.studentfirst.academy), a learning platform for Nigerian A-level students with past questions, search, and more.
